I'm a software developer specializing in Java and Spring, with a bit of JavaScript and React. I love
experimenting with Spring, delving into its inner workings and creating the most effective
solutions. I am always results-oriented and take the quality of the software I develop extremely
seriously.

I love learning new technologies, practices and framework capabilities. I strive to constantly
improve and not stand still in developing my skills. I also like to experiment and implement my
ideas in personal projects. You can find out more about this on my GitHub page.

When I'm not coding, I read books, research topics that interest me, or play video/board games, and
attend swimming classes.

I am open to collaboration opportunities where I can contribute, learn and grow. I expect
interesting tasks from my new job, without monotony and with visible results. If you have a good
opportunity that matches my skills and experience, don't hesitate to contact me.
