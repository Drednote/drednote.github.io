My second project started as a project specifically written for public access on GitHub and which
was supposed to show my level of skills. He wasn't supposed to be anything special. But in the
process of writing code, I got the idea to make a useful library that not only I would use.

When writing this project, I had to dive deeper into many aspects of how Spring works in order to
change them for the workflow of telegram bots. At first, it was quite difficult to dive into the guts
of such a large framework, but the deeper I dived, the more I learned and understood. This gave a
noticeable boost in knowledge about Spring.

After a while, I understand that the code I wrote is just the foundation for the further development
of the library. And I hope I will have time to improve it.
