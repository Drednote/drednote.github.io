My **second** project is the creation of a library, which is the basis for writing **telegram bots** in the ecosystem
`Spring`.

While developing this project, I had to **deeper** dive into many aspects of the framework. I designed
`workflow` for processing incoming requests from the `Telegram` platform, created **controllers** for processing them
and developed a custom `Bean Scope` to manage the lifecycle of beans in this `workflow`. These steps allowed me to
create a library that is **highly flexible and extensible** and provides a solid development framework
various types of **telegram bots** in the `Spring` ecosystem.

I'm very interested in **exploring new and innovative ways** of writing code to create more **flexible** and
**effective** bots. I hope that I will have the opportunity to continue to develop this library and work on new ones
projects.
