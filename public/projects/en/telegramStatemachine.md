This is my first fairly large project, and the first project that I posted on GitHub. Initially, I
wrote it for internal use and did not plan to make it publicly available.

At that time, I began to get interested in Telegram bots, and tried different ways to work with
them. The technology that I wanted to try was Quarkus, and it also seemed to me that State Machine
was ideal for working with telegram bots. As a result, we managed to combine these two technologies
in one project. Later I abandoned both Quarkus and State Machine in its original form.
