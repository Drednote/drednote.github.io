This is my **first** independent project that I posted on `GitHub`. At that moment I was fascinated by studying
**telegram bots**, and I was looking for different ways to expand my knowledge.

I decided to look into **native compilation** and chose the `Quarkus` framework, which provides **fast startup time**
and **low memory consumption**, which can be useful for bots. In addition, I used the `State Machine` pattern,
to **manage dialogues** with users, **command processing** and various scenarios in the telegram bot.

Although **native compilation** provides high performance, it has **a number of limitations** when
used, and the capabilities of `State Machine` turned out to be insufficient to cover the entire range of bot
functionality. This project was an **interesting experience** that allowed me to deepen my knowledge of the two
technologies.
